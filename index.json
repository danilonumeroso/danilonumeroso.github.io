We generate informative counterfactual explanations for a specific prediction under the form of (valid) compounds with high structural similarity and different predicted properties. We discuss preliminary results showing how the model can convey non-ML experts with key insights into the learning model focus in the neighborhood of a molecule.","tags":["Workshop"],"title":"Explaining Deep Graph Networks with Molecular Counterfactuals","type":"publication"}]
